We have the three files which correspond to the collections in MongoDB:

- loadZones.json
- powerPlants.json
- transmissionLines.json

- ba_lz.json : a mapping of the balance areas to their load zones

- lz_projs.json:  I modified the loadZones.json to key the projects by loadZone ID as opposed to being an empty array

- load_zone_projects.json: Projects from Sergio's data
